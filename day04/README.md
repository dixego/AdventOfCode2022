# Day 4
I'm starting to realize I'm solving the problem in Rust by thinking about how I would
solve it in Haskell and then just writing the Rust version of that solution (and then the
Haskell version afterwards, which is always more concise, obviously). Dunno if this is
the right thing to do, but given that most AoC problems are "process this list of inputs
in a certain way" I suppose if it's *entirely* strange that most solutions can be given as
compositions of mappings, which Haskell is quite good at expressing.
