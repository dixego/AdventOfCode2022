# Day 1 of Advent of Code 2022! Woohoo!

Couldn't decide what language to do this in so I just did the top two contenders. 
We'll see if I stick with both the whole way.
Ran the Haskell solution with `runhaskell` and the Rust one with `cargo script`. 

Pretty simple problem, definitely more verbose in Rust than in Haskell, plus I suspect i
could have used less `collect::<Vec<...>>()`s.
